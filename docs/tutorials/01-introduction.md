Leb, inspired by the Luo word for 'language,' is a project dedicated to the seamless integration of Sunbird AI Language Technology. Our goal is to empower developers to effortlessly create machine learning models for Neural Machine Translation (NMT), Speech-to-Text (STT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and other language-related applications.

By drawing inspiration from the Luo concept of 'language' itself, Project Leb is envisioned as a springboard for connecting ideas and cultures across the Africa's diverse range of tongues and dialects. Just as languages connect people, this technology would connect languages - old and new - through an inclusive platform optimized for integration, accessibility, and human-centric design.
